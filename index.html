          <h4>A few of the people I've worked with...</h4>
          <div>
          <h5 class="employer">Digital Content Strategist @ <a href="https://www.oleinteractive.net/home-1">Ole Interactive</a></h5></div>
          <div><p>I came into Ole Interactive as an intern, and within six months of being there, I found the need to resurrect several websites bought by the company. This led me to work alongside Reynaldo Riobueno to create the content discovery department. I worked as the team's primary content director across various platforms. Curated content and developed licensing guidelines for a team of 40+ to be implemented on daily tasks. Focused on creating brand awareness and engagement, I successfully developed, executed, and oversaw the entire content strategy. 
          </p></div>
          <div><h5 class="employer">Account Manager @ <a href="https://www.hputerman.com/">Hazkel Puterman & Associates</a></h5></div>
          <div><p>My time at Hazkel Puterman & associates was crucial for my career. I came in as an Account Manager with a background in advertising, and my view shifted utterly. Along with Hazkel, I developed a brand tailored to a different market than he was currently working with. Among this brand development, I created and successfully executed a media plan & marketing strategy, leading to increased sales and overall brand awareness. This strategy was carried on through the company during my time there and is still implemented.</p></div>
