          <h4>A little background...</h4>
          <p>Iâ€™m always in search of exciting and fun projects to take on, even if I have a lot on my plate. I enjoy curating my own <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/nadinealmaleh1?si=471310c16a374ef4">playlists</a>, indulging in history books, late-night movie discussions, writing for blogs, and interesting content finds on my daily web browsing. Runs are my jam, whether theyâ€™re long, short, or talkative, but you can learn more about that on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/68099319">Strava.</a> I have a strong passion for art direction, but content strategy has my heart. If youâ€™d like to know more about me, keep reading ;)</p>

          <h4>A few of the people I've worked with...</h4>
          <h5><a href="https://www.oleinteractive.net/home-1">Ole Interactive</a></h5>
          <p>I came into Ole Interactive as an intern, and within 6 months of being there, I found the need to resurrect several websites bought by the company, this led me to work alongside Reynaldo Riobueno, to create the content discovery department.  I worked as the team's primary content director across all their different platforms. Curated content and developed licensing guidelines for a team of 40+ to be implemented on daily tasks. Focused on creating brand awareness and engagement, I successfully developed, executed, and oversaw the entire content strategy. </p>
          <h5><a href="https://www.hputerman.com/">Hazkel Puterman & Associates</a></h5>
          <p>My time at Hazkel Puterman & associates was crucial for my career. I came in as an Account Manager, with a background in advertising, and my view shifted completely. Along Hazkel, I developed a brand tailored to a different market than what he was currently working with. Among this brand development, I created and successfully executed a media plan & marketing strategy which led to increased sales and overall brand awareness. This strategy was carried on through the company during my time there, and is still implemented.</p>
